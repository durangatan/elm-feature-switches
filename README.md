# elm-feature-switches

fetches and displays Kinja feature switches for the purpose of demonstrating Elm.
Gotta use [this here api](http://www.github.com/duranje/elm-feature-switch-api)

## Serve locally:

```
npm start
```

*   Access app at `http://localhost:8080/`
*   Get coding! The entry point file is `src/elm/Main.elm`
*   Browser will refresh automatically on any file changes..

## Build & bundle for prod:

There is no prod. But if you want to see how it looks all bundled up:

```
npm run build
```

*   Files are saved into the `/dist` folder
*   To check it, open `dist/index.html`
